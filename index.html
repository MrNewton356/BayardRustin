    <h2>First Acts or Activism</h2>
    <p2>Rustin eventually left the Young Communist Party and focused on protesting racial segregation in the U.S. armed forces.  He traveled the country speaking out after the launch of the Congress of Racial Equality in 1942. Years later, he was arrested for refusing to appear before the draft board as a conscientious objector, serving 26 months in prison. Even within jail, he angered authorities with desegregation protests and open homosexuality.</p2>
    <h3>Bayard and the Civil Rights Movement</h3>
    <p3>In 1962, A. Philip Randolph, a labor and civil rights organizer, recruited Rustin to help with the March on Washington, wanting to ensure that economic issues, as well as civil rights, were part of the platform. Rustin traveled back to Alabama to meet with King and began organizing with other coalitions and movements such as the National Urban League, the NAACP, and Southern Christian Leadership Conference. However, Rustin’s sexuality came into play again, when Roy Wilkins of the NAACP refused to allow Rustin to be the front man. It was decided that Randolph would serve as the March’s director and Rustin would be his deputy.  The 1963 March on Washington would go on to be hailed as one of the most monumental nonviolent protests in history, and no title change could take away Rustin’s contributions to it. From this, Bayard became known as “Mr. March on Washington.”</p3>
